# ANSI-C Basic Hash Table

Based on https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table.

Made it for one of my university assigments. Very simple and easy to understand Hash Table.

The HashTable gets a key and a value which are string (or char pointers to be precise). If you want to look for a value - you use the `search` function. The HashTable supports all of the CRUD operations - Create (insert), read(search), update(insert) and delete(delete).
